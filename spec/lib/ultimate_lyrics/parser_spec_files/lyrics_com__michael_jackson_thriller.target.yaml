:result: "It's close to midnight \nAnd something evil's lurking in the dark\nUnder
  the moonlight \nYou see a sight that almost stops your heart\nYou try to scream\nBut
  terror takes the sound before you make it\nYou start to freeze \nAs horror looks
  you right between the eyes\nYou're paralyzed\n\n'Cause this is thriller, thriller
  night\nAnd no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike\nYou know it's
  thriller, thriller night\nYou're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
  tonight, yeah\n\nOoh, ooh\nYou hear the door slam \nAnd realize there's nowhere
  left to run\nYou feel the cold hand \nAnd wonder if you'll ever see the sun\nYou
  close your eyes \nAnd hope that this is just imagination\nGirl, but all the while
  \nYou hear a creature creepin' up behind\nYou're out of time\n\n'Cause this is thriller,
  thriller night\nThere ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes,
  girl\nThriller, thriller night\nYou're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
  tonight\n\nNight creatures call\nAnd the dead start to walk in their masquerade\nThere's
  no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)\nThis is the end
  of your life, ooh\n\nThey're out to get you\nThere's demons closin' in on every
  side\nThey will possess you \nUnless you change that number on your dial\nNow is
  the time \nFor you and I to cuddle close together, yeah\nAll through the night \nI'll
  save you from the terror on the screen\nI'll make you see\n\nThat this is thriller,
  thriller night\n'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try\nThriller,
  thriller night\nSo let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller\nChiller,
  thriller here tonight\n'Cause this is thriller, thriller night\nGirl, I can thrill
  you more than any ghoul would ever dare try\nThriller, thriller night\nSo let me
  hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow\n\nI'm gonna thrill you tonight\nDarkness
  falls across the land\nThe midnight hour is close at hand\nCreatures crawl in search
  of blood\nTo terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)\nAnd
  whosoever shall be found\nWithout the soul for getting down\nMust stand and face
  the hounds of hell\nAnd rot inside a corpse's shell\n\nI'm gonna thrill you tonight\nThriller,
  ooh baby (thriller)\nI'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)\nThriller, all
  night, oh baby\nI'm gonna thrill you tonight\nThriller, thriller night (oh baby)\nI'm
  gonna thrill you tonight\nThriller, all night (oh baby)\nThriller night, babe (thriller
  night, babe), ooh\n\nThe foulest stench is in the air\nThe funk of forty thousand
  years\nAnd grizzly ghouls from every tomb\nAre closing in to seal your doom\nAnd
  though you fight to stay alive\nYour body starts to shiver\nFor no mere mortal can
  resist\nThe evil of the thriller\n"
